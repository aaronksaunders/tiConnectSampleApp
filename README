This is a sample project showing how to create a sync adapter that integrates with [IBM BlueMix - Mobile Cloud](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#starters/mobile/index.html#overview)

IBM BlueMix Credentials... Use Your Own!!
=====
This code utilizes the following credentials which can be found in the `config.json` file

	"env:development": {
		"bluemix" : {
			"appId" : "244246c0-bf7a-41f9-b561-f71815d33bd8",
			"appSecret" : "e1567ab2d13015d9dbef414213e7ac6bdb1c8530"
		}
	},

Hacking of alloy.js to get promises to work
=====

We are using promises in this adapter to avoid the pain of callback hell, see more information on callbacks here
[Q Promises - A tool for making and composing asynchronous promises in JavaScript](http://documentup.com/kriskowal/q/)

We had to do some special hacking here to get promises to work in the sync adapter because of the way that controllers and models are created; basically they do not return anything after the object is created and that is where I needed to return the promise.

So if you look in the `alloy.js` file in the project's root directory, you will see that I overrode the creation methods for the Collection and the Model. The only change is the addition of the return from the sync call

    // line 21 & the same on line 43
    return mod.sync(method, model, opts);

A Better HTTPClient

[Titanium Version of SuperAgent](https://github.com/tipm/superagent) helps to make the code in the sync adapter cleaner
